About me
======
Sumanth specialized research focusses on Emissions control techniques and algorithms to improve engine efficiency and meet emission standards. This includes new OBD analysis techniques for Exhaust Gas Recirculation, Gasoline Particulate Filter controls on hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrids, mild hybrids, and Conventional Gasoline engines. My Findings progress other researchers understanding of next generation powertrain actuators and sensors as it applies to electronic devices and Hybrid electric vehicles ,particularly in the electronics and automotive industries of the United states needed in achieving decreased Particulate emissions and increase Powertrain efficiency

Sumanth’s publication consist of  8 peer-reviewed scientific articles , 50+ Patents/Patent applications in the area of Powertrain Controls with patents Licensed internationally under a confidential licensing agreement .He holds 165 citations of which 120 citations from peer-reviewed scientific articles and 45 citations from patents . Sumanth also conducted 100 reviews for distinguished Journals, Conference, invited speaker for several International conferences and he is also the Associate Editor for two prestigious journals in the area of Hybridization and mobility :  SAE International Journal of Engines  and International journal of engines .Sumanth works with Government agencies like California Air Resource Board , Environment Protection Agency  in the rulemaking process for Emission regulations, drafting the framework with several other industry experts under NOx   Tracking Parameter Accuracy Task Force committee . Sumanth’s current research focusses on I6 engine project funded by the grants from the U.S Department of Energy.
